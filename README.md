# 3) CPPE Dataset EDA 
- To perform EDA, I have chosen CPPE - 5 (Medical Personal Protective Equipment) dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/cppe-5).
- To execute this EDA, please direct into folder /EDA and open/run the "CPPE Dataset EDA.ipynb" file.
  Each cell contains the info/explanation of the code cell.
- This is an object detection dataset in which 5 different classes are supported (Coverall (0),Face_Shield (1),Gloves (2),Goggles (3) and Mask (4)).
